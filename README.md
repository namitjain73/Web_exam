# Travel Planner with Itinerary + Expense Splitter

## Overview
Group trips are fun, but the planning is usually a mess—random WhatsApp chats, buried email confirmations, and the classic headache of splitting expenses.  
This project solves all of that in one place.

A collaborative travel app where groups can plan trips together, upload essential documents, track shared expenses, and settle dues with minimal transactions.

## Features

### Itinerary Planning
- Add, edit, and manage events in a shared timeline  
- Real-time collaboration for all group members  
- Suggestions for places to visit (future scope or optional module)

### Document Management 
- Upload tickets, hotel vouchers, IDs, and other files  
- Easy access for the entire group

### Expense Splitting
- Add shared expenses (e.g., dinner, cab, activities)  
- Select the participants for each expense  
- Automatic balance calculation  
- “Who owes who” is computed with minimal transactions  
- Settle payments and update the ledger instantly
