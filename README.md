# Travel Planner with Itinerary + Expense Splitter

## Overview
Group trips are fun, but the planning is usually a mess—random WhatsApp chats, buried email confirmations, and the classic headache of splitting expenses.  
This project solves all of that in one place.

A collaborative travel app where groups can plan trips together, upload essential documents, track shared expenses, and settle dues with minimal transactions.

## Features

### Expense Splitting
